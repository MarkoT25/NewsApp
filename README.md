# NEWS APP

This is a simple News App developed as a part of a Frontend Task. The application fetches news articles from the NewsAPI and displays them in a list view. Users can also search for news articles by keywords and can click on an article to view its details. In addition, users can bookmark articles for later viewing.

## Installation

To run this app, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project folder in your preferred IDE.
3. Install the necessary dependencies by running npm install in the terminal.
4. Run npm start to start the development server.
The app should be available at http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.


## Usage

Once you have the app running, you can use it to view news articles and search for articles by keywords. To search for articles, simply enter a keyword in the search bar and click "Search". The app will fetch news articles from the NewsAPI that match your search query and display them in the list view.

To view the details of an article, simply click on the article's title in the list view. This will take you to a page with more information about the article, including its title, author, and a short description. If you want to save the article for later viewing, you can simply click on the bookmark icon located on each article. The bookmarked articles will be saved in the Bookmarks section, which can be accessed from the navigation bar at the top of the page.

## Design

The design of this app is focused on simplicity and usability. The app uses a clean and minimalistic design that puts the focus on the news articles themselves. The list view is easy to scan, with each article's title, author, and date clearly visible. Users can easily bookmark articles for later viewing by clicking on the bookmark icon located on each article. The bookmark icon is designed to be easily recognizable and distinguishable from other icons on the page, using a solid outline and a bright color to draw the user's attention.

The bookmarked articles are then saved in the Bookmarks section, which can be accessed from the navigation bar at the top of the page. The Bookmarks section uses a similar design as the list view, with each bookmarked article displayed as a card with its title, author, and date. Clicking on a bookmarked article will take the user to the article's details page, where they can read the full article.

The search bar is prominently placed at the top of the page, making it easy for users to find the articles they're looking for. In addition, the app's color scheme is designed to be easy on the eyes and provide a pleasant reading experience. The use of white space and typography ensures that the text is easy to read and doesn't strain the eyes.
